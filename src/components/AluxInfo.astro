        Aluxes are mythical creatures from the Mayan folklore of the Yucatan
        Peninsula, particularly in Mexico. They are small, impish beings often
        described as mischievous spirits or supernatural guardians of the
        natural world. Aluxes are believed to inhabit the forests, caves, and
        other natural formations.

      <p class="text-white">
        In Mayan tradition, Aluxes are considered as the protectors of crops,
        forests, and bodies of water. They are known to either help or hinder
        those who encounter them, depending on how they are treated by humans.
        It is believed that offering gifts or prayers to the Aluxes can bring
        good fortune, while disrespecting them can lead to mischief and
        misfortune.
